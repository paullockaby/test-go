## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions! Please be cognizant of the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) when interacting with or contributing to this project. You may contribute in many ways:

* By filing bug reports. Please use GitHub Issues to submit any bugs that you may encounter.
* By filing feature requests. Be aware that we may not implement every feature request but we will evaluate them and provide feedback.
* By submitting pull requests. Please use GitHub to submit pull requests.
* By writing documentation. If you see something that could be explained better or is not explained at all, please submit a pull request to update the documentation. Alternatively, just submit an issue describing what is unclear and how it could be more clear and we will endeavor to update the documentation.

If you choose to submit a pull request please follow these guidelines:

* Please provide a clean, concise title for your pull request and a clear description of what you are changing so that it may be evaluated more effectively.
* Limit any pull request to a single change or the minimum number of changes necessary to achieve the feature or bug fix. Many smaller pull requests are preferred over fewer, larger pull requests.
* No pull request will be reviewed unless and until the linter and the tests pass. You can the linter and the tests locally and we encourage you to do so.
* Not every change can or may be accepted. If you are uncertain whether your pull request would be accepted then please open an issue before beginning work to discuss what you would like to do.
* This project is licensed using the Apache License and that by submitting code you accept that your code will be licensed the same.

Again, please use GitHub Issues and GitHub Pull Requests to communicate with the project. It is the fastest and most effective way to be heard.

If you have security feedback you can reach out to [contact@paullockaby.com](mailto:contact@paullockaby.com) to raise your security finding in a confidential manner so that we may provide a fix when the vulnerability is made public. If you are not sure that your feedback is security related please err on the side of caution and send the email. The worst that will happen is you will be asked to create a GitHub Issue.
